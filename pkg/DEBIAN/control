Description: DNS server with a focus on service discovery
 CoreDNS is a DNS server that chains plugins. Each plugin performs a DNS
 function. CoreDNS can be used in many different environments because of its
 flexibility. It can serve as a zone file DNS server, an SRV record resolver,
 a reverse proxy to upstream DNS servers, and more.
